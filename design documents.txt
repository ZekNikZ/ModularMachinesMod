PinType - registered with custom registry (RESOURCE_ITEM, DATA_INT, DATA_BOOL, CONTROL_FLOW)
 -> has linked input pin type
 -> has linked output pin type
 
nodes have declared input and output pins which the blockentity or container link with a list of connections
when a node is "done", it gets all of its connections and runs `transferData()`

data input pins somehow need a way to have a "default/configured value" which will look something like this:

     +--------+
     |  Node  |
 +---|        |
 | 2 >Data    |
 +---|        |
     |        |
	 +--------+
   
   (i.e., a way around having to have dedicated "constant" nodes connected to each)
   
GuiWidget registry - I may not need a registry for this but it may help enforcing consistency   
   
Nodes register a series of GUI widgets (text, image, integer, block pos, etc.)

(Data) input nodes can register a GUI form widget to be their "default value" editor

Input nodes which don't declare a widget provide null by default
